Furniture Store Sales and Inventory Optimization
============================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project focuses on analyzing the sales, profitability, and inventory management of a U.S.-based furniture retailer using a publicly available dataset. The objective was to identify key operational challenges, such as loss-making product sub-categories, aggressive discounting practices, regional disparities, and inventory inefficiencies, and propose data-driven solutions to optimize business performance.

Using Tableau for data visualization and forecasting, this project delivers actionable insights to help the retailer improve profitability, streamline inventory management, and achieve sustainable growth.

Key Objectives
--------------

-   Analyze historical sales and profitability trends (2014--2018).

-   Identify inefficiencies in product categories, discounting strategies, and inventory management.

-   Examine regional disparities in sales and profitability.

-   Propose actionable recommendations based on data insights.

-   Utilize forecasting techniques to predict future trends and optimize inventory levels.

Dataset
-------

-   **Source**: Kaggle

-   **Dataset Overview**:

    -   Records spanning 2014--2018.

    -   Contains detailed information on:

        -   **Order Details**: Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode

        -   **Customer Information**: Segment, Region, State, City

        -   **Product Details**: Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

Tools Used
----------

-   **Tableau**: For data visualization and forecasting.

-   **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.

Methodology
-----------

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation

-   Acquired the dataset from Kaggle, ensuring it was anonymized and publicly available.

-   Cleaned and prepared data using Excel, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing categorical fields.

### Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

-   Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Tableau to identify patterns and trends.

-   Created visualizations, including:

    -   **Bar Charts**: To analyze sub-category profitability.

    -   **Scatterplots**: To study the relationship between discounts and profit margins.

    -   **Line Charts**: To observe sales and profit trends over time.

    -   **Forecasting Models**: To predict inventory demand and future sales trends.

### Step 3: Insights Derivation and Recommendations

-   Synthesized insights from visualizations to formulate actionable solutions:

    -   Optimize discount strategies.

    -   Improve regional performance.

    -   Streamline inventory management using demand forecasting.

Findings and Insights
---------------------

### Sub-Category Profitability

-   **Finding**: Tables and Bookcases incur losses despite significant sales volumes.

-   **Recommendation**: Revise pricing models and discount strategies to improve profitability.

### Impact of Discounts

-   **Finding**: Discounts above 40% lead to negative profit margins.

-   **Recommendation**: Cap discounts at 15--20% to balance sales growth and margins.

### Regional Performance

-   **Finding**: The West region leads in profitability, while the Central and South regions underperform.

-   **Recommendation**: Replicate successful strategies from the West region in underperforming regions.

### Inventory Management

-   **Finding**: Stockouts in high-demand sub-categories like Tables and overstocking in others increase costs.

-   **Recommendation**: Implement forecast-driven inventory management and safety stock levels.

### Sales-to-Profit Trends

-   **Finding**: Sales growth does not align with profitability due to operational inefficiencies.

-   **Recommendation**: Optimize operational costs to align profitability with sales growth.

Proposed Solutions
------------------

1.  **Optimizing Discounts**: Set discount caps and focus on high-margin products.

2.  **Enhancing Regional Performance**: Target underperforming regions with tailored strategies.

3.  **Streamlining Inventory**: Use Tableau's forecasting tools to balance stock levels.

4.  **Aligning Profitability with Sales Growth**: Regularly monitor operational costs and adjust pricing strategies.

Conclusion
----------

This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in identifying and addressing operational inefficiencies. By implementing the proposed recommendations, the furniture retailer can transform loss-making segments, optimize inventory, enhance regional performance, and achieve long-term profitability and growth.

Future Work
-----------

-   Integrate real-time data for dynamic inventory management.

-   Incorporate customer behavior analysis to refine discounting strategies further.

-   Expand the analysis to include external market factors and competitor benchmarks.
